<h1>String</h1>
<p>In computer programming, a string is traditionally a sequence of 
characters,either as a literal constant or as some kind of variable.The 
latter may allow its elements to be mutated and/or the length changed, 
or it may be fixed (after creation).A string is generally understood as a
 data type and is often implemented as an array of bytes (or words) that
 stores a sequence of elements, typically characters, using some 
character encoding.A string may also denote more general array data 
types and/or other sequential data types and structures;terms such as 
data type string or string of data types are sometimes used to denote 
strings in which the stored data represents other data types.</p>
